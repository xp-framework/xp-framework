Ports collection for XP framework: README
======================================================================
$Id$

Overview
--------
This is the directory layout:

- principals/   Principals collection, containing groups and identities
- classes/      User collections (e.g. de.thekid)
- dist/         Distributed ports
- xpi/          The XP installer
- xp.ports.mk   Makefile include

Directory "principals"
----------------------
This directory contains information about groups and identities.
Information herein is stored in VCard format. A group is identified
by the key "X-XP-MULTIREF"'s value, being a list of identifiers 
pointing to other groups and/or identities.

An example of a group VCard:
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:2.1
  FN:Core Developers
  N:;Core Developers
  X-XP-MULTIREF:xp://identity/friebe;xp://identity/kiesel
  URL:http://xp-framework.net/
  EMAIL;INTERNET:xp@php3.de
  END:VCARD

An example of an identity VCard:    
  BEGIN:VCARD
  VERSION:2.1
  FN:Timm Friebe
  N:Friebe;Timm
  ADR;HOME:;;Essenweinstr. 3;Karlsruhe;;76131;Germany
  EMAIL;INTERNET:xp@thekid.de
  BDAY:1977-12-14
  URL:http://thekid.de/
  NICKNAME:thekid
  END:VCARD

Identity VCards are stored in the subdirectory called "identity".

These files are used to identify users referenced by 
META-INF/collection.xml within a collection and / or port.

Directory "classes"
-------------------
This is where the user collections reside. Every collection contains
a subdirectory named META-INF at its toplevel, providing meta 
information about a collection. This information is stored in an XML
file called collection.xml

An example:
  <?xml version="1.0" ?>
  <!DOCTYPE collection PUBLIC 
   "-//XP Framework//Collection DTD 1.0//EN" 
   "http://xp-framework.net/dtd/collection_1_0.dtd"
  >
  <collection name="de.thekid">
    <version>0.1</version>
    <summary>Classes used in Timm's private projects</summary>
    <maintainers>
      <maintainer id="xp://identity/friebe" role="lead"/>
    </maintainers>
  </collection>

The maintainer ID references a group or identity from the directory
principals, mentioned above.

Directory "dist"
----------------
This is where the implementations reside, e.g. static content, property
and configuration files, web sites' document root, etc.

To make it easier to find a port, this directory is split up into a set
of subdirectories as following:

- www/           Web-based utilities
  + forum/
  + guestbook/
  + album/
  + site/

- databases/     Database related
  + admin/
  + view/
  + shell/

- devel/         Development
  + ide/
  + editor/

- messaging/     Communication
  + irc/
  + mail/
  + news/
  + messenger/

- webservices/   SOAP/XML-RPC webservices
  + soap/

- sysutils/      System utilities
  + cli/

- desktop/       Desktop applications
  + util

(This list may be extended after discussing changes on the developer's 
mailing list).

Each of these directories again contain subdirectories, being the actual
location of your implementation. For example, the fully qualified path 
relative to this directory of the Forum at thekid.de may be

./dist/www/forum/thekid

Within this "implementation" directory, you'll typically find the following
files and subdirectories:

- Makefile      Makefile, typically including ../../../../xp.port.mk
- unittest.ini  Unit Test configuration
- conf/         Configuration files (php.ini / Apache / etc.)
- etc/          Property files
- xpinstall/    XP Installation configuration
- doc_root/     Document root for web sites
- rpcrouter/    Document root for web services
- doc/          Documentation
- tools/        Tools, e.g. statistics, configuration creator, ...
- bin/          Command line scripts for sysutils/cli
- ui/           User interface files for GTK applications (.glade/.xpm)
- META-INF/     Meta information (see above)
