Scope of Change
---------------
XP will become its own language, that is, PHP with syntax additions, some
of which have been described in RFC #0008. (JIT-)Compilers will be created 
to create PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3 (with namespaces) sourcecode from the new 
language.


Rationale
---------
Designing the XP programming language we had the following goals in mind:

* Get rid of the oddities in PHP - alternative syntaxes like if / endif 
  for example or "__"-magic.
* Overcome limitations in the PHP grammar that do not allow chaining at
  all points like method calls after new() and array access after method
  calls.
* Support syntactically what the XP framework has built ontop of PHP:
  annotations, type-safe enums, return types, thrown exceptions, finallly,
  with() blocks.
* Integrate with the XP Framework's foundation classes.
* Keep the "change and run" spirit and the ability for rapid development.

Generally speaking, we've tried to follow the "less is more" principle and
tried making the syntax more concise as to what it's doing.


Functionality
-------------
Like in the XP framework, the entry point is always a class. In their most
simple form, these classes have a static <tt>main()</tt> method. An example:

<code>
  public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(string[] $args) {
      util.cmd.Console::writeLine('Hello World from ', self::class.getName(), '!');
    }
  }
</code>

Now you will already start noticing things:
* Classes may also have modifiers.
* The "extends Object" is optional and added by the compiler if omitted.
* The keyword "function" is gone and replaced by the return type. Because
  the main() method does not return anything, we use "void".
* An array type is written as component[]
* Variables still have dollar signs. This makes it easy to spot them,
  that's why we've decided to keep this!
* Fully qualified classnames are written with dots.
* The object operator is also a dot (at the same time, the string 
  concatenation operator is now the tilde, ~).

Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the above example, it first needs to be compiled:
<pre>
  # Compile source to HelloWorld.class.php
  $ xcc HelloWorld.xp
  ...
  
  # Now run it, as usual
  $ xp HelloWorld
</pre>

The compilation process may produce warnings and errors. The latter lead 
to a failure, while warnings are only informational. Examples of errors 
are parse errors as well as syntactical and structural errors where the 
compiled code itself would be erroneous - like method bodies in interface 
declarations or unresolveable types. Warnings depend on the error handler 
installed in the compiler - in a JIT-compiler, where things have to go 
fast, no warnings may be issued at all as their computation takes time.
In the standard error handler, type mismatches or missing members are 
warnings, for example. In a more pedantic version, missing api docs or
usage of deprecated features will be reported.

JIT
~~~
JIT - or "Just in time" compilation will occur whenever a source class
is available. 

The class loader currently performs the following steps:
<summary>
For each delegate:
1. Ask whether it provide the class
2. If it does, tell it to load the class; then return it
3. Otherwise, ask the next delegate

If no delegate provided the class raise an exception. As code, this 
would be:
<code>
  foreach ($ld in self::$delegates) {
    if ($ld.providesClass($class)) return $ld.loadClass($class);  
  }
  throw new ClassNotFoundException($class);
</code>
</summary>

The new functionality will be:
<summary>
For each delegate:
1. Ask whether it provide the class
2. If it does, tell it to load the class; then return it
3. Otherwise, see if this delegate provides source in any of the syntaxes
4. If it does, compile the first source found and return the compiled type
5. Otherwise, ask the next delegate

If no delegate provided the class raise an exception. As code, this 
would be:
<code>
  foreach ($ld in self::$delegates) {
    if ($ld.providesClass($class)) return $ld.loadClass($class);
    
    // {{ Check for source
    foreach ($syntax in self::$supportedInputSyntaxes) {
      if (!$ld.providesSource($class, $syntax.extension())) continue;

      try {
        new CompilationTask(
          $ld.getSource($class, $syntax.extension()),
          $nullDiagnostic,
          $jitFileManager,
          $sourceEmitter
        ).run();
      } catch (CompilationException $e) {
        throw new ClassFormatError($class, $e);      
      }
      return $jitFileManager.getType($class);
    }
    // }}
  }
  throw new ClassNotFoundException($class);
</code>
</summary>

Because this will cause quite a performance impact, the JIT class loader 
is an optional feature that must be turned on - this is NOT recommended 
for production systems.

Installing the JIT classloader:

* Must be done via xp.ini, the only user-specific file
* use_xp=~/devel/xp/trunk



Typing
~~~~~~
The XP language knows about the following types:

* Primitives
  The following primitives exist: int, float, string, bool
* Reference types
  Classes, interfaces and enums, e.g. lang.Object, util.log.Traceable
  and util.DateInterval
* Array types
  An array is a zero-based and continuously numbered list of any type, 
  e.g. string[] or util.Date[].
* The variable type
  Marks a type that may either be a primitive or any reference type, 
  declared with the keyword "var". The compiler will not be able to 
  verify type correctness in this case and will warn about this -
  checks will be deferred until runtime.

The following elements need to be typed:
* A: Member variables
* B: Method parameters
* C: Return type

Local variables don't need to be typed or declared. Their type will be
inferred on initialization (D).

Example:
<code>
  public class Person {
    public string $name;                  // A
    
    public void setName(string $name) {   // B
      $this.name= $name;
    }
    
    public string getName() {             // C
      return $this.name;
    }
    
    public function toString() {
      $s= $this.getClassName();           // D, typeof($s) = string
      $s~= '<' ~ $this.name ~ '>';
      return $s;
    }
  }
</code>

Namespaces
~~~~~~~~~~
Namespaces are called "packages" in the XP language. A package does not
exist as its own entity, instead, classes belong to a one by declaration:

<code>
  package de.thekid.dialog;
  
  public class Album {
    // ...
  }
</code>

Imports
~~~~~~~
Importing is a compile-time feature to enable to use short versions
of names but actually mean the longer ones. The "Hello World" example
from above could be rewritten as follows:

<code>
  import util.cmd.Console;
  
  public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(string[] $args) {
      Console::writeLine(...);
    }
  }
</code>

Also available are static imports which makes writing a line to the
console even shorter to write:
<code>
  import static util.cmd.Console.writeLine;
  
  public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(string[] $args) {
      writeLine(...);
    }
  }
</code>

At the same time, to avoid name clashes with PHP's native functions,
these also need to be imported:
<code>
  import native standard.substr;
  import native mysql.mysql_connect;
</code>

To enable rapid prototyping, type import on demand can be used:
<code>
  import util.*;
  import static util.cmd.Console.*;
  import native sybase_ct.*;
</code>

Chaining
~~~~~~~~
It is now syntactically possible to continue writing after <tt>new</tt>
and to use array offsets on method return values:

<code>
  new Date().toString();
  XPClass::forName($name).getMethods()[0];
</code>

Varargs syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To create functions that accept a variable amount of arguments - 
<tt>printf</tt> is probably the most famous one of them, you have to
resort to <tt>func_get_args()</tt> in PHP userland. The XP language
supports this feature by adding <tt>...</tt> to the parameter's type:

<code>
  public class Format {
  
    public static string printf(string $format, var... $values) {
      // Implementation here
    }
    
    public static void main(string[] $args) {
      self::printf('%d args passed to %s', $args.length, self::class.getName());
    }
  }
</code>

This will make the <tt>format</tt> variable contain the format string and 
<tt>values</tt> consist of an array with two values (the length and the 
class name).

Changed foreach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The <tt>foreach</tt> loop has changed from the form you know it in PHP
to one inspired by C#.

<code>
  foreach ($method in $class.getMethods()) {
    Console::writeLine('- ', $method);
  }
</code>

Ternary shortcut
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ternary shortcut supported in PHP 5.3 upwards will be supported by the
XP language:

<code>
  $a= $a ?: $b;   // Same as: $a= $a ? $a : $b;
</code>

Array syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The <tt>array</tt> keyword from the PHP language has been replaced by
the shorter form with square brackets. By means of an extension array
length can be determined by using the <tt>length</tt> pseudo-member.

<code>
  $a= [1, 2, 3];           // same as $a= array(1, 2, 3);
  $i= $a.length;           // same as $i= sizeof($a);
</code>

Arrays can also have types:
<code>
  // Instantiation
  $a= new string[] { 'Hello', 'World' };
  
  // Type
  public static void main(string[] $args) { ... }
</code>

Class literal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Every class has a static member called <tt>$class</tt> which will 
retrieve the <tt>lang.XPClass</tt> object associated with it.

<code>
  // same as $c= XPClass::forName(xp::nameOf(__CLASS__));
  $c= self::class;
  
  // same as $c= XPClass::forName('lang.types.String');
  $c= lang.types.String::class;
</code>

Finally: Finally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Especially for cleaning up - and yes, even in 2009 with the amount of
memory and computing power we have available - it is still necessary to
ensure, for example, file handles are properly closed:

<code>
  $f= new File($name);
  try {
    $f.open(FileMode::READ);
    return $f.read(0xFF);
  } finally {
    $f.close();
  }
</code>

Enumerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The XP framework already offers type-safe enumerations. These were
originally introduced in RFC #0132 and are now supported with an easier-
to-type syntax:

<code>
  public enum Weekday {
    Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
  }
</code>

Enumerations may also have methods:
<code>
  public enum Coin {
    penny(1), nickel(2), dime(10), quarter(25);
    
    public string color() {
      switch ($this) {
        case self::$penny: return 'copper';
        case self::$nickel: return 'nickel';
        case self::$dime: case self::$quarter: return 'silver';
      }
    }
  }
</code>

Members can have methods attached, too:
<code>
  public abstract enum Operation {
    plus {
      public int evaluate(int $x, int $y) { return $x + $y; }
    },
    minus {
      public int evaluate(int $x, int $y) { return $x - $y; }
    };
    
    public abstract int evaluate(int $x, int $y);
  }
</code>

Annotations
~~~~~~~~~~~
Also supported for quite a while in the XP Framework are annotations.
They use "#" one-line comments and are parsed from the class' source when 
accessed inside the reflection API (see also RFC #0016). The XP language 
can do without this workaround, of course!

<code>
  public class ArrayListTest extends unittest.TestCase {
  
    [@test] public void emptyList() {
      $this.assertEquals([], new ArrayList().values);
    }
  }
</code>

What happens technically:
Annotations are stored in the xp registry. The reflection API will 
retrieve them from there instead of having to parse the class files
at runtime.

Anonymous instance creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To generate "throw-away" instances the XP framework provides the 
<tt>newinstance()</tt> functionality, originally described in RFC #0080.
With the downside of having to declare the class body inside a string
and the added overhead of runtime evaluation, this feature is now not
only more elegant to write but classes created this way will also be 
declared at compile time:

<code>
  $emptyFiles= new io.collections.iterate.IterationFilter() {
    public bool accept(io.collections.IOElement $e) {
      return 0 == $e.size;
    }
  };
</code>

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~
Properties are special member variables that instead of directly
accessing a class field may have methods attached. This way, we can
create short syntax but still stay flexible if we need to change
the underlying implementation.

<code>
  import native standard.strlen;
  
  public class String {
    protected string $buffer;
    
    public __construct(string $initial= '') {
      $this.buffer= $initial;
    }
  
    public string length {
      get { return strlen($this.buffer); }
      set { throw new IllegalAccessException('Cannot set string length!'); }
    }
    
    public static void main(string[] $args) {
      $s= new String('Hello');
      $l= $s.length;   // 5
      $s.length= 1;    // *** IllegalAccessException
    }
  }
</code>

Internally, this is implemented by compiling <tt>__get()</tt> and 
<tt>__set()</tt> interceptors.

Indexers
~~~~~~~~
The PHP language allows for userland overloading of array operations
via the <tt>ArrayAccess</tt> interface and its <tt>offset*</tt> methods.
This is kind of different from the usual PHP approach with <tt>__</tt>
"magic" methods - in the XP language, it's the property syntax again:

<code>
  public class ArrayList<T> {
    protected T[] $elements;
  
    public __construct(T... $initial) {
      $this.elements= $initial;
    }
    
    public this[int $offset] {
      get   { return $this.elements[$offset]; }
      set   { $this.elements[$offset]= $value; }
      isset { return $offset >= 0 && $offset < $this.elements.length; }
      unset { throw new IllegalAccessException('Immutable'); }
    }
    
    public static void main(string[] $args) {
      $a= new ArrayList<string>('One', 'Two', 'Three');
      $one= $a[0];      // 'One'
      $a[2]= 'Drei';    // Now: One, Two, Drei
    }
  }
</code>

With syntactic sugar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A keyword "with" is added.

Usage:
<code>
  with ($tree->addChild(new Node('tagname')) as $node) {
    $node->setAttribute('attribute', 'value');
  }
</code>

What happens technically:
The with statement, essentialy a no-op, is resolved to the following 
sourcecode:

<code>
  $node= $tree->addChild(new Node('tagname');
  $node->setAttribute('attribute', 'value');
</code>

Throws clause
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Methods will be allowed to have a declarative throws-clause. Unlike the
throws-clause in Java, blocks executing a function or method with a 
throws clause and not handling the list of contained exception will not
lead to a compile-time error. 

Declaration:
<code>
  public function connect() throws IOException, ConnectException {
    // ...
  }
</code>
The thrown exceptions can be retrieved by means of the reflection API.

What happens technically:
The thrown exceptions will be stored in the xp registry. The reflection
API can retrieve them from there.


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
Overall development experience will be slower because of the necessary
compilation step. The generated sourcecode will show the same runtime
performance, in some cases even better.


Dependencies
------------
None, the compiler will emit valid PHP sourcecode using the XP framework.
Compiled classes can even use source classes and vice versa.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Experiment shows this could be done via auto_prepend_file.

friebe, Sun Jan 29 02:11:23     2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Maybe static imports would also be a worth a try?
<code>
  import static util·cmd·Console·writeLine;
  
  writeLine('Hello');
</code>

kiesel, Tue Jan 31 15:38:38 CET 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The meta-compiler should take care of keeping the current line numbers
consistent across files. One will be able to associate an error with a
code line.
(My) experience shows, this is an important feature.

kiesel, Tue Jan 31 15:40:24 CET 2006
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One may think about creating multiple compilers - or, one compiler with
multiple modes: eg. debugging, release. The debug compiler would add
more checks on type hints or return types while the release compiler
would skip those in favor of speed.

friebe, Tue Nov 10 13:20:04     2009
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Rewrote this RFC completely - removed PHP4 and PHP6, added all features
currently implemented.
