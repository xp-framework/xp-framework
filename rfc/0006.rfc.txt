Scope of Change
---------------
Implement a generic serialization / deserilazation mechanism, being
able to tell whether an object can be safely serialized.

Rationale
---------
The builtin function serialize() does not preserve the fully qualified 
class name and thus does not make sure the correct class is loaded 
during deserialization.

Furthermore, with an own implementation, we will also be able to add
versioning and checking on non-serializable class constellations.

Functionality
-------------
Detecting whether a specific class is serializable will be determined
by checking if the class implements the Serializable interface. Not
all classes will be serializable by defaulting - this is not necessary.
Especially the database connection classes, File or Folder, e.g., need 
not be serialized as their internal structures point to resources which
aren't deserializable.

Example:
<?php
  class Date extends Object {
  
    // ...
    
  } implements(__FILE__, 'io.Serializable');
  
  $d= &new Date();
  
  // Serialize the date object
  $s= &new FileSerializer(new File('date.ser'));
  try(); {
    $s->serialize($d);
  } if (catch('SerializationException', $e)) {
    $e->printStackTrace();
    exit(-1);
  }
  
  // Unserialize it
  $u= &new FileDeserializer(new File('date.ser'));
  try(); {
    $d= &$u->deserialize();
  } if (catch('SerializationException', $e)) {
    $e->printStackTrace();
    exit(-1);
  }
?>

Dependencies
------------
Serializable interface.
Serializer/Deserializer classes.

  How do we declare properties "transient". transient is used to mark 
  member variables that should not be saved during object serialization.

  Rejected, this tries to prevent users from serializing a File
  or SybaseConnection instance; which really doesn't happen very
  often, and if it does, it should be quite clear why it doesn't
  work as expected.
