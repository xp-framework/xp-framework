RFC 0078: Workflow Scriptlet next generation
========================================================================
$Id$

@authors: friebe
@created: Thu Oct 12 11:43:43 CEST 2006
@status: draft
@category: scriptlet.xml.workflow

Scope of Change
---------------
The Workflow Scriptlet API will be changed to be more flexible and to
contain more common use cases.


Rationale
---------
There is not enough infrastructure around the workflow scriptlet API.


Functionality
-------------

Summary: API changes / enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<pre>
* One scriptlet for all scenarios:
  scriptlet.xml.workflow.WorkflowXMLScriptlet will replace the
  AbstractXMLScriptlet. There will be no need to extend this class.

* Filters will be added.
  Pre-Filters can influence request data and routes.
  Post-Filters can influence response data.
  Around-Invoke-Filters are a composite of Pre- and Postfilters

* Routing API will be added.
  Routers map URLs to states

* Facades API will be added.
  Facades are use-case implementations and group several states

* Permissions and roles system
</pre>

Summary: Minor adjustements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<pre>
* The HttpScriptletException will extend ChainedException
</pre>


Use case: Weblog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Database driven
- Views as well as "admin" area
- Admin area requires login
- View may look different when logged in (e.g. "edit" buttons)
- Views may be cached
- Cache needs to be invalidated on changes in the admin area / when
  adding comments, e.g.

Use case: Static contents, generated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- For example, XP apidocs
- Depending on request, one state "loads" XML for display (maybe even
  only by means of document('...') in XSLT)

Use case: Search page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Does not use Handler/Wrappers
- May be reloaded as often as wanted to refresh search results
- Should not be cacheable by browsers
- Provides results split up into smaller blocks (users can navigate
  through them by using next and previous operations)
- Results may require filtering (e.g. based on access permissions /
  content / other policies)

Use case: Portal pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Consist of a number if portlets the user has configured to appear
- Default list of portlets may exist
- May have different layouts, e.g. one or more columns, whith different
  sizes
- Uses predefined portlets (e.g., an RSS reader) as well as own 
  implementations
- Page (or parts of it) may be cached
- Portlets should be configurable inline (an RSS reader portlet may allow
  configuration of the feed's URL and how many items to show)
- Drag&Drop support for aligning the portlets
- Which portlets are to be displayed will be configured elsewhere, e.g.
  inside a popup window

Use case: "Ordering process" / Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Consists of multiple stepts
- Uses a cart
- Users may jump back and forth between states
- Is complete when all steps are satisfied with the data they have collected
- May contain switches (alternative paths), e.g. distinction between
  new customers (need customer data / address / payment preferences) and
  existing customers (user customer number and password)

Use case: Table view / "sheet"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Displays list of rows
- Can be filtered by ranges, patterns or value(s)

Use case: Logon page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Asks username and password
- Loads userdata
- Brute force protection
- Forgot password
- May need to provide masterlogin ability


Details: Filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Get rid of need for AbstractAuthenticatedState
- Add possibility to easily add remote-host based access policies (pre-
  filter) as well as gzencode (post-filter)

Details: Routers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO!

Details: Facades
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1) EntityManagementFacade
  - Backing by database (DataSet API) or EASC (Remote API)
  - Has the following operations
    Modify: Create
    Modify: Edit
    Modify: Delete
    View  : List (optional, may be problematic w/ large amount of data)
    View  : Search (optional, may be useless w/ little amount of data)
    Entity: Show
  - The "Modifiy" operations may trigger additional business
    logic (e.g., invalidate or even recalculate cache contents)
  - The delete operation may only mark entries as deleted (and not 
    really delete them). The view operations should then respect
    the marks

Details: Permissions and roles system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO!


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
None, filters are an optional addition.


Dependencies
------------
- RFC #0117
  Package class

- RFC #0107
  More information about table fields in rdbms.Peer

- RFC #0099
  Finder API

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- RFC #0096
  Foreign key relations (for EntityManagementFacade DB backing)
  Would make the editor work for more than only one table
