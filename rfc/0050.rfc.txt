@status: implemented, Mon Jan 16 12:08:34 CET 2006
@category: rdbms

Scope of Change
---------------
The rdbms.Criteria::add() method will be changed to accept either the 
current list of arguments (string key, mixed value, const comparison)
or a new and more flexible Criterion instance.


Rationale
---------
The current way does not permit construction of complex SQL queries.


Functionality
-------------

1) Simple criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SQL:
<pre>
  select ... where domainname = "thekid.de"
</pre>

Current (and still valid) functionality:
<code>
  new Criteria(array('domainname', 'thekid.de', EQUAL));
</code>

New functionality, using the Restrictions factory:
<code>
  new Criteria(Restrictions::equal('domainname', 'thekid.de'));
</code>

New functionality, using the Property object:
<code>
  $domainname= &Property::forName('domainname');
  new Criteria($domainname->equal('thekid.de'));
</code>


2) Using OR
~~~~~~~~~~~
SQL:
<pre>
  select ... where expire_at > "2006-01-05" or deleted = 1
</pre>

Current (and still valid) functionality:
<code>
  // Not feasible with Criteria's old API, need to use hardcoded SQL
  new Statement(
    'select ... where expire_at > %s or deleted = %d',
    Date::now(),
    TRUE
  );
</code>

New functionality, using the Restrictions factory:
<code>
  new Criteria(Restrictions::anyOf(
    Restrictions::greaterThan('expire_at', Date::now()),
    Restrictions::equal('deleted', TRUE)
  ));
</code>

New functionality, using the Property object:
<code>
  $expire_at= &Property::forName('expire_at');
  $deleted= &Property::forName('deleted');

  new Criteria(Restrictions::anyOf(
    $expire_at->greaterThan(Date::now()),
    $deleted->equal(TRUE)
  ));
</code>

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two variants:

1) Patch Criteria minimally to support the Criterion instances.

2) Change Criteria to use the SimpleExpression class for the
   current API.

See below for diffs.


Security considerations
-----------------------
n/a


Speed impact
------------
- Variant #1: An instance check in add() and one for every condition
  added in the toSQL() loop.

- Variant #2: One instance check in add(), but uses of objects 
  instead of simple arrays in Criteria's member conditions.


Dependencies
------------
- For variant #2, the SimpleExpression class would need to be added to
  Criteria's uses() list.

  The methods Restrictions::eitherOf() and Restrictions::bothOf() have 
  funny-sounding names. Maybe we can come up with better ones?

- friebe, Tue Jan 10 17:20:06 CET 2006
  The methods in the Restrictions and Property classes generally have 
  quite long names. Hibernate uses ge() instead of greaterThanOrEqualTo(). 
  Should we abbreviate this far?

- friebe, Thu Jan 12 12:31:18 CET 2006
  I think we should just rename eitherOf() to anyOf() and then support
  two *or more* arguments, and bothOf() to allOf(), doing the same
  to the argument list.

  Implementation variant #1 patch is out-of-date, the changes suggested
  in the previous comment are only available in the patch for #2.

  Intoducing a formal, language independent representation of sql queries
  should not overlook its many features and try to include into it as many as
  humanly possible.

  Having this in mind, I will refer to subqueries, and to yet a more sensitive
  subject, linked subqueries. (as in when the subquery uses a field from the
  parent subquery). One may say "NO WAY" can we represent this, but I stand to
  think it's not that complicated, given a proper starting point.

  Also, I will try to depict a form of the same formal representation that
  could be used in representing JOINS across tables.

  Representing database entities as objects and classes is definitely not new,
  and for sure what I'm going to say here has already been said a few times,
  but saying it again is never a bad ideea...

  Say we see a table as a container, instance of a TABLE class, namely a
  container of columns. So each little column is a instance of the COLUMN class
  and it can tell which table it's from and what type it bears.

  SELECT
  Then, we see a query as an instance of the QUERY class. Each query has a from
  part. The from part is always composed of tables. So we need to keep a
  collection of all the tables the query is on. COLLECTION QUERY.FROM<TABLE>

  On the data side, a select holds a set of expressions which are calculated by
  the query. So we need to keep a collection of all the expressions that are to
  be selected. COLLECTION QUERY.FIELDS<EXPRESSION>.

  EXPRESSION should be a class, that should be composable out of other
  expressions and together with OPERATORS. So an operator, together with a set
  of expressions should form another expression. There also should be simple
  expressions, that are formed of just one column EXPRESSION(COLUMN). Also,
  there should be simple expressions that are formed with literals, or that
  represent function calls EXPRESSION.SUM(COLUMN)
  EXPRESSION('literal'); EXPRESSION(6100);

  To build expressions with operators, we may use static factories of the
  EXPRESSION class. EXPRESSION.SUMOF(EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION, ..). Also, because
  columns are usually part of expressions, they should be able to generate
  expressions with themselves. COLUMN.ADDWITH(EXPRESSION). COLUMN.DIVIDEBY(
  EXPRESSION). etc.

  And because expression would be such a big thing... why not have it in the
  WHERE clause aswell? After all... those are expressions too!

  So like, COLUMN.GREATERTHAN(EXPRESSION), COLUMN.EQUALS(EXPRESSION);
  And to link with logical operators, something like above.
  EXPRESSION.ANYOF(EXPRESSION, EXPRESSION, ...);
  
  You said something about joins...
  Yes, here it is. Because joins can be written in an equivalent way with join
  clauses in the FROM section, or with conditions in the WHERE section, you
  could easily write a query that contains in the where clause, something like
  COLUMN.INNERJOIN(COLUMN) or COLUMN.LEFTJOIN(COLUMN).

  Table Aliases?
  You could build regular tables with new TABLE() or aliases with TABLE(
  'alias').

  Subqueries?
  An expression should support to have as a rightvalue an QUERY object.
  EXPRESSION(QUERY). And if in that query you used a column for an alias that
  is also used in the parent query, you just got a linked subquery.

  Example:
  I'm not sure this is right :) But this query will give you the person
  which has the largest salary in each departament.

<pre>
  SELECT headDept.name, emp.name FROM
    departament headDept, employee emp
  WHERE
    emp.departament=headDept.id
    AND
    emp.salary IN (
      SELECT MAX(salary) FROM
        employee max
      WHERE max.departament=headDept.id
    )
</pre>

<code>
  $hotShots= &new Query();
  $subquery= &new Query();
  
  $headDept= &$hotShots->from(new DepartamentTable('headDept'));
  $emp= &$hotShots->from(new EmployeeTable('emp'));
  $max= &$hotShots->from(new EmployeeTable('max'));

  $subquery->from($max);
  $subquery->select(Expression::max($max->salary));
  $subquery->where(
      $max->departament->equals($headDept->id);
    )
  );
  
  $hotShots->select($headDept->name);
  $hotShots->select($emp->name);
  
  $hotShots->where(
    Expression::allOf(
      $emp->departament->innerJoin($headDep->id),
      $emp->salary->in(new Expression($subquery))
    )
  );
</code>

    Before continuing development and including subqueries, joins, 
    projections and everything else, I'd like to start with what
    was proposed in the "functionality" section of this document.
    Let's keep the query / table / column API from the previous
    comment for another RFC.
