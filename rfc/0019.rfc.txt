Scope of change
---------------
Introduce a peer.ldap.LDAPQuery class that controls how queries with 
peer.ldap.LDAPClient are done.

Rationale
---------
Inspired by rdbms.DBConnection's prepare() method, LDAP queries should
also have some way to sanitize query input: it's needed to simplify
LDAP access and ensure the correctness of LDAP queries.

This is the continuation of the rdbms collection's success of formulating
queries in a way that makes them immune against SQL code injection.

Functionality
-------------
Example:
<code>
  $ldap= &new LDAPClient('ldap.openldap.org');
  $ldap->connect();
  $ldap->bind();
  
  $res= &$ldap->search(new LDAPQuery(
    'ou=permissions,o=openldap,c=DE',
    '(&(objectClass=simpleSecurityObject)(|(userName=%s|email=%s)))',
    $_REQUEST['input'],
    $_REQUEST['input']
  ));
  
  $res= &$ldap->search(new LDAPQuery(
    '(&(objectClass=%c)(uid=%d))',
    '*',
    1552
  ));
</code>

More subtile settings can be done, too:
<code>
  [...]
  
  $query= &new LDAPQuery();
  $query->setScope(LDAP_SCOPE_SUB);
  $query->setBase('ou=permissions,o=openldap,c=DE');
  $query->setFilter('(&(objectClass=foo)(uid=%d))', $_REQUEST['userid']);
  $res= &$ldap->search($query);
</code>

To offer a full interface for an LDAP query, peer.ldap.LDAPQuery should offer
accessors to change query parameters like attributes, attrsonly, sizelimit,
timelimit and deref.

Security considerations
-----------------------
The new class would automatically take untrusted input and escape all dangerous
characters dependant on the used token to a secure replacement.
This change is supposed to make the LDAP query infrastructure more secure.

Speed impact
------------
The change adds the need to create one more object for an LDAP query, so it will
be slightly slower and has a bigger memory footprint. However, LDAP queries
involve a socket connect and network I/O, so the overhead caused by this change
will be a smaller factor.

Dependencies
------------
n/a

  LDAPClient::search() already exists and would need to be able to
  distinguish if an LDAPQuery object or its current first parameter,
  string base_dn. Maybe it would be a good idea to name the new
  function searchBy()?

  Should LDAPClient class get a member $base, which contains the default
  base? This could make some things simpler.

- kiesel, Mon May 16 12:08:39 CEST 2005
  What should be the default search scope? Should the scope be configureable
  with the default constructor?

- kiesel, Mon May 16 12:10:13 CEST 2005
  Should all input be automatically encoded to UTF-8? This may be suitable
  on iso-8859-1 systems, but sometimes could require manually decoding input
  before passing to the LDAPQuery class.
