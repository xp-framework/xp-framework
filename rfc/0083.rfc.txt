Scope of Change
---------------
The ClassLoader's defineClass() method will be changed to use
include() with an own stream wrapper instead of eval().

Rationale
---------
In case the class brings up a fatal error at runtime, a
meaningful error message can be shown instead of a message
like "Fatal error at eval'ed code at line XXX in 
lang/ClassLoader.class.php".

Functionality
-------------
The defineClass() method will prepare a string containing the
bytes of the new class and store pass it to a class implementing
the stream_* functions.

Instead of calling eval() with that string, it will include() the
new class with the artificial "inline://"-protocol - invoking the 
stream wrapper.
The stream_wrapper returns the class bytes. PHP will be able to
associate a constructed filename with the inline code and show
that in any case of error.

Speed impact
------------
The new execution model is around 3-4 times slower than the
previous!
This insight has been made through the following simple benchmark
script:

Benchmark script:
<code>
  require('lang.base.php');
  
  $cl= ClassLoader::getDefault();
  for ($i= 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
    $cl->defineClass(
      'net.xp_framework.runtime.DefinedClass'.$i,
      'class DefinedClass'.$i.' extends Object {}'
    );
  }

</code>

Old execution speed:
ak@boost ~/devel/xp.public/trunk $ time php test.php 

real    0m7.850s
user    0m7.300s
sys     0m0.550s

New execution speed:
ak@boost ~/devel/xp.public/trunk $ time php test.php 

real    0m25.181s
user    0m22.090s
sys     0m3.080s

The slow execution is probably due to many additional PHP userland function
calls and string manipulations. However, defining a class is usually not
a task that happens nearly that often as in the provided benchmark script.

The developer community has to decide whether the useful additional debugging
information outweights the speed loss.
