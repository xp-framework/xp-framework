Scope of Change
---------------
In case the same PHP error occurs multiple times, it will no longer be 
added to the error registry on each occurence. Instead, a counter will 
keep track how many times this error has occured.


Rationale
---------
Prevent running out of memory in a situation where a loop is causing
an error in each of its iterations.


Functionality
-------------

Take the following script:
<code>
  for ($i= 0; $i < 1000; $i++) {
    $a.= '';    // E_NOTICE: Undefined variable:  a
    unset($a);
  }
</code>

At the moment of writing this RFC, this will cause 1000 new elements to
be added to the xp error registry. When the changes this RFC suggests
are implemented, this will result in 1 element being added to the error
registry and its occurrence counter being equal to 1000.

Now if an exception is thrown from somewhere in this block, you'd get a 
really long stacktrace containing all the E_NOTICEs from the loop:
<pre>
Exception lang.Exception ()
  at lang.Exception::__construct((0x0)'') [line 87 of StackTraceElement.class.php] 
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a
</pre>
(shortened for brevity)

With this patch, the stacktrace will look like this:
<pre>
Exception lang.Exception ()
  at lang.Exception::__construct((0x0)'') [line 0 of StackTraceElement.class.php] 
  at php.<main>::<main>() [line 5 of st.php] Undefined variable:  a (... 999 more)
</pre>
Please note the "... 999 more" indicating this error has occured a total of 1000 
times.

Security considerations

Speed impact
------------
- Possible slight decrease in error handler

But:
- Memory footprint decrease in error handler at the same time

- Performance increase in xp::errorAt() for the case file *and* line
  number are passed in

- Performance increase in lang.StackTraceElement's toString() method

Over all, this should be slightly faster for the general case.


Dependencies
------------
This introduces a small BC break in lang.StackTraceElement: The member
$messages (an array) is replaced by a member $message (a string).
