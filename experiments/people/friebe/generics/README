Generics support experiment
========================================================================
$Id$


What's this?
------------
This is an experiment to show how rudimentary generics support could be
embedded into the XP framework.


Generics in general
-------------------
Think of generics as specifications of a type's component(s). For example,
a List<string> is a list of strings, and a Map<string, Object> is a map
of strings and Objects.

Declaring generic classes
-------------------------
To declare a generic class, prepend (enclosed by < and >) the generic
tokens. From thereon, these tokens can be used as type hints for a
method's arguments (passing incorrect values to these will result in 
an IllegalArgumentException at runtime).

Examples:
<?php
  class SortedList<E> extends Object {

    function add(E $item) {
      // ... implementation
    }
  }
  
  class IdentityMap<K, V> extends Object {

    function put(K $key, V $value) {
      // ... implementation
    }
  }
?>


Using generic classes
---------------------
In this experiment, generics are imported by using the "generic" scheme:

<?php
  uses('generic+xp://fully.qualified.class.Name');
?>

The modified import functionality is provided by the generic uses 
wrapper.


Instantiating generic classes
-----------------------------
Generic classes are not instantiated by new but by a function called
create().

<?php
  $hash= create('GenericHash<int, lang.Object>');
  $hash= create('GenericHash<int, lang.Object>', $arg1, $arg2);
?>


The inner workings
------------------

Class loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The generic uses wrapper (located in sapi/generic.uwrp.php) tokenizes
the sourcecode of the class file and translates it into valid PHP(4)
sourcecode. It also stores information about the tokens used in the
generics declaration and associates them to the class it has parsed.

When a class declaration is encountered and this token contains
generics tokens, these tokens are parsed and stored. A member variable
named __types is generated. This member will contain the runtime types
of the generic object and will be set by the create() function.
The generics declaration is omitted from the generated sourcecode.

The following:
<?php 
  class SortedList<E> extends Object { } 
?>

will become:
<?php 
  class SortedList extends Object {
    public $__types= array();
  }
?>

and the registry for "List" will contains array(0 => "E").  

When a method declaration is encountered, its argument list is parsed.
If the argument list contains type hints, these are stored. The
method's statement list is prepended with a verification mechanism
that will check the arguments' types.

The following:
<?php 
  class SortedList<E> extends Object { 
  
    function add(E $element) {
      // ...
    }
  } 
?>

will become:
<?php 
  class SortedList extends Object {
    public $__types= array();

    function add($element) { 
      uwrp·generic::verify($this, 'add', array('E' => $element));
      // ...
    }
  }
?>
This way, method invocation can be avoided in case incorrect types are
passed.


Instanciation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The create() function takes care of creating instances of generic classes.
It parses the string given to it as first argument, which is expected to
contain the name of the class to be instanciated and the component types.

Example:
<?php
  $list= create('SortedList<text.String>');         // #1
  $hash= create('IdentityMap<int, lang.Object>');   // #2
?>
#1: Here, "SortedList" is the class name and "String" the component type.
#2: Here, "IdentityMap" is the class name and "int" and "Object" are the
    component types. 

An instance of the class is created without invoking the constructor.
The runtime types are deferred and assigned to the created instance's
__types member. For #1, the member would contain { "E" => "text.String" },
for #2, it would be { "K" => "int", "V" => "lang.Object" }.

After creation, the constructor is called if existant.


Type verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When a method that had type hints defined is called, the verification
mechanism checks each of the arguments hinted against the runtime type
information hash. In case the component type is one of ['int', 'float', 
'string', 'null', 'bool', 'array'], the equivalent is_XXX() function 
is used to check. For any other component type, the is() XP core 
function is used to check the argument.

In case the check fails, an IllegalArgumentException() is thrown.
