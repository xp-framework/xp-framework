Chain experiment
========================================================================
$Id$


What's this?
------------
Show how invocation chains can be simulated in PHP. An invocation chain 
is something like:

  $cat= &Logger::getInstance()->getCategory();
  $instance= &XPClass::forName($class)->newInstance();
  $e= &new Expectancy()->method('sayHello')->isInvoked(1)->with(array('World'));
  $value= $this->getCategories()[0]->getValue();

  
The first two are already possible in PHP5, whereas the latter two
aren't.


How this works
--------------
A "chain" function takes care of the work. The "parts" of the chains are
passed to it as arguments and are evaluated by the function, returning
the result of the chain and breaking execution if an error occurs.

* See chain-function.php for more details on the internal workings.
* See ChainTest for how to translate chains to chain function calls.


Why this experiment was created
-------------------------------
Investigate possibility of implementing method chaining for RFC #0052.
