Introduction
------------
This patch introduces functionality suggested in the XP RFC 0008 (see
http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/co.php/rfc/0008.rfc.txt)

Currently implemented
---------------------
* Packages
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/packages

* Operator overloading
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/operator_overloading

* Throws clause
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/exceptions

* IException interface
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/exceptions

* Annotations:
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/syntax

* Instance creation expression:
  http://cvs.xp-framework.net/horde/chora/cvs.php/experiments/arena/php5/syntax
  
* Allowing NULL for type-hinted parameters. Example:
  <?php
    class Client {
      public function setTrace(LogCategory $cat= NULL) {
        echo xp::typeOf($cat), "\n";
      }
    }
    $client= new Client();

    // Will print out "util.log.LogCategory"
    $client->setTrace(Logger::getInstance()->getCategory());

    // Will print out "NULL"
    $client->setTrace(NULL);

    // Will also print out "NULL"
    $client->setTrace(NULL);
  ?>

* Comparison operator
  The new comparison operator "<=>" returns 0 if the expressions on both 
  sides are equal, -1 if the left side is smaller and 1 if the right hand
  side is smaller. This is basically the same what strcmp() does, only that
  implementing it as an operator yields quite a bit of performance.
  
  1 <=> 2   // -1
  2 <=> 1   // 1
  1 <=> 1   // 0

  
  This is particularily useful for callbacks to any of the *sort() functions.

Making it work: Patching configure.in
-------------------------------------
configure.in (in the php CVS top-level directory) needs to be patched with
the file configure.in.patch before anything.

Making it work: Using the patch
-------------------------------
The patch needs to be applied against a current CVS checkout of PHP5. Go to
the Zend directory, run "php zend_vm_gen.php", compile, then run the tests. 

Be sure to do a "make clean" before - the zend_globals struct and 
zend_op_array structs have been changed (and therefore their size) - 
otherwise you'll experience crashes all over the place.

Making it work: Using the engine
--------------------------------
You can also use the Zend subdirectory from with this directory instead of
the one that you get when you do a CVS checkout of PHP. Move the original
Zend directory away, create a new one and copy this directory's contents to
it. Make sure to run cvsclean, buildconf, configure and make in the PHP 
source directory (in this order).
