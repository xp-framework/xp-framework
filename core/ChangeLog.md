* Added support for rolling logfiles to `util.log.FileAppender` via
  PR #353 - (@kiesel, @thekid)

### Bugfixes

* Fixed invocations of `htmlspecialchars()` to supply an encoding, so
  it behaves the same over PHP versions, see issue #367 (@kiesel)

## 5.9.11 / 2013-12-13

### Bugfixes

* Fixed REST marshalling and unmarshalling not working recursively. See
  issue #344. Note: To not break BC, the TypeMarshaller's marshal() and
  unmarshal() methods' signatures remain unchanged; and implementing 
  instances must declare the added marshalling parameter to both methods
  as optional! - (@thekid)
* Fixed unknown token exception for TDS_CURDECLARE* on certain queries

  resources URIs being concatenated. Aftermath of fix for issue #335
  (@haimich, @thekid)


## 5.9.9 / 2013-11-09

### Heads up!

* Split responsibilities in REST APIs: Deserializers read from the stream
  formats, e.g. XML or JSON, to data structures, while unmarshallers then
  convert this to the target types, e.g. a value object. See RFC #269.
  This deprecates `Rest(De)Serializer::convert()` which was a mix of both.
  See https://github.com/xp-framework/xp-framework/pull/307#issuecomment-27854895
  (@thekid, @iigorr)
* Changed REST client to always append resources to base path, whether
  they're supplied in an absolute form or relative. See #334 - (@thekid)
* Switched annotation parser in lang.XPClass to a more robust implementation
  based on token_get_all(). This also fixes previously undefined behaviour
  with class constants, and gives more verbose error messages for malformed
  annotations, both without having a negative impact on performance or 
  memory usage. See pull request #328 - (@thekid)
* Converted proprietary classes in "xp" package as well as unittest classes
  to namespaces / new coding standards - (@thekid)

### RFCs

* Implemented RFC #269: REST: Marshalling and serialization. See also pull
  request #307 and issue #306 - (@thekid)
* Implemented RFC #272: Unittest actions. See pull request #318 - (@thekid)
  http://news.planet-xp.net/article/552/2013/10/14/

  using the "cclient" (ext/imap) library - (@thekid)
* Fixed InternetAddress::fromString() no to return surrounding quotes around
  realnames, e.g. `"Alex Kiesel" <kiesel@example.com>` - (@thekid)
* Fixed "Uninitialized string offset: 1" from XPClass::parseDetails() when
  parsing code with closures using "use" in their declaration - (@thekid)
* Fixed img.util.ExifData to trim excess whitespace / NUL characters from
  maker software - (@thekid)
* Fixed issue #329: REST errors are text/html but should be text/json - (@thekid)
* Fixed typo in exception message in lang.XPClass::getConstant() - (@thekid)
* Fixed lang.XPClass::parseAnnotations() to support combined long and short
  array syntaxes in annotations, either way around - (@thekid)

### RFCs

  raises an exception - (@kiesel, @thekid).
* Fixed webservices.rest.Payload::equals() method for arrays - (@thekid)
* Fixed issue #325: Serialization of 'Closure' is not allowed - (@thekid)
* Fixed io.streams.TextReader class not reading first chunk correctly when
  character set auto-detection fell back to iso-8859-1 - (@thekid)
* Fixed StreamTokenizer::pushBack() not working correctly if previously
  read all the way to the end - (@thekid)
* Fixed issue #324 - Encoding not handled correctly in JsonDecoder; the
  bug here is that it doesn't raise an exception for malformed input!
  (@thekid)


## 5.9.7 / 2013-07-24

  (@iigorr, @thekid)

### Bugfixes

* Fixed issue #321 - REST Handler does not return anything unless @return

### Features

* Implemented a secure storage for sensitive strings, e.g. passwords - see
  pull request #315 - (@kiesel)
* Added timeout handling to peer.server API. Defaulting to 60 seconds - a 
  client that does not perform any protocol actions in this period will be
  ungracefully disconnected - (@thekid)
* Added a better error message for PHP runtime version mismatch - see 
  discussion in issue #316 - (@thekid, @kiesel)

  Just casting those arguments to string will result in memory overflow
  fatal errors or segfaults like these:
